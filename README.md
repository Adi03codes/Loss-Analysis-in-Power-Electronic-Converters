## Background

Power electronic converters such as inverters, rectifiers, and DC-DC converters introduce losses due to their semiconductor switching and conduction properties. These losses affect the overall system efficiency and thermal performance. Accurate loss estimation and analysis enable better design choices, improved thermal management, and higher reliability.

## Objectives

- Identify and model key loss mechanisms in power electronic converters.  
- Simulate losses under varying load and switching frequency conditions.  
- Analyze the impact of switching devices and passive components on total losses.  
- Provide insights to optimize converter design for minimal losses.

## Methodology

Losses are categorized and computed based on:

| Loss Type              | Description                                              |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Conduction Losses     | Losses during the ON state of semiconductor switches      |
| Switching Losses      | Losses during the turn-on and turn-off transitions        |
| Passive Component Losses | Losses in inductors, capacitors, and transformers        |

Using device datasheets and analytical formulas, these losses are modeled and integrated into MATLAB/Simulink simulations.

## Simulation Setup

- Developed converter models including IGBT/MOSFET switches and passive components.  
- Applied variable load currents and switching frequencies to analyze dynamic loss behavior.  
- Used Simscape Electrical for detailed switching and conduction loss modeling.  
- Generated plots for loss breakdown, efficiency curves, and thermal implications.

## Results and Discussion

- Switching losses increase significantly with switching frequency, while conduction losses depend mainly on load current.  
- Passive components contribute a smaller but non-negligible portion to total losses, especially at higher frequencies.  
- Efficiency optimization requires balancing switching frequency and conduction losses.  

### Sample Loss Distribution (at 50 kHz switching frequency)

| Loss Component          | Percentage of Total Losses |
|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Conduction Losses      | 45%                        |
| Switching Losses       | 40%                        |
| Passive Component Losses | 15%                      |
